Then we ask user to guess the number , then we throw hints by suggesting that if used guessed number is less or more than the radom number. Then we ask user to again guess the number , we again give hint and to these again and again untill the number becomes equal to randomly genrated number.Atlast we return number of guesses user to took to guess the number."
